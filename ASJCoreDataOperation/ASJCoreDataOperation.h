You can tie it with a "NSFetchedResultsController" to do async fetches so that the main thread is not blocked. This parameter is optional, and if you don't provide a managed object context, one will be created internally.
 *  @param mainMoc You can pass a managed object context with "NSMainQueueConcurrencyType". If you have created your project with CoreData enabled, the default moc in AppDelegate.m is of this type. You can, if you wish pass it in this argument, but it you keep it nil, it will attempt to access the same from your AppDelegate.
